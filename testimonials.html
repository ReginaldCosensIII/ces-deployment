                            <p class="quote-card-text">"Since transitioning to CES as a break/fix I.T. company to a managed I.T. service provider, the most significant benefit for me and my company has been reliable and proactive support. CES’s managed services model ensures that our systems are monitored, maintained, and optimized consistently. This has significantly reduced downtime and allowed us to focus on our core business operations. Over the past 18 years, CES has consistently demonstrated expertise, responsiveness, and trustworthiness. Their team understands our unique needs, provides tailored solutions, and stays up-to-date with industry trends. The long-standing relationship we’ve built with CES is a testament to their commitment to excellence. If someone is considering CES as their I.T. firm, I would say: “Choose CES for their dedication to customer success, technical proficiency, and unwavering support. They truly partner with you to ensure your technology works seamlessly, allowing you to focus on your business.”</p>

                            <p class="quote-card-text">"Our group has expanded exponentially over the last decade. It was apparent that we needed an I.T. team to work with our practice to keep up with our rapid growth and expansion. The biggest benefit of working with CES is having a team of trusted, knowledgeable technicians who are available to us anytime and can assist us. They have a Help Desk Request system that allows us to communicate our needs and their response time is quick to solve our I.T. questions or concerns. Another benefit of switching to CES is they monitor our systems (i.e. back-ups, storage space, vulnerabilities, etc.) and recommend solutions to prevent problems with our network before they occur. It is nice having an I.T. company that is proactive and has our best interest at heart. CES employs technicians who are very friendly and knowledgeable. They always answer the phone or respond to communication promptly. This customer service aspect is very important to us and sets them apart from other companies we have used. If anyone is considering investing in CES as an IT firm, I would say, “Just do it! Invest in your I.T.! This is something that you use every day; I would say that it is an important investment! Think of your I.T. company as a valuable member of your team."</p>

With cyber security challenges on the rise, it is comforting to know that CES is on top of all the latest computer technology and security risks and they are far more reasonable than what an in-house I.T. department would cost for our small business. If there are any problems, or if we need any additional services or support, they are quick to assist. We can take care of business knowing that CES has our back regarding the efficiency of our systems and the security of our data. Unless you or someone else in your company has the knowledge and time to take care of the constantly changing field of computer systems and data security, leave it to the experts at CES."</p>

CES knows that every issue is important to the client and they address the basic computer issues with the same level of concern as the larger issues. In addition to their good response rate, I find it easy to discuss issues with them and their employees are very pleasant. CES has assisted us after normal business hours to ensure our communication with our citizens is working and to fix any issues. There are not too many I.T. companies that are willing to be that dedicated."</p>
